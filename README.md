# mp4srt
A command-line tool for generating subtitles (SRT files) for MP4 videos using Whisper AI API

The application will transcribe the audio from your MP4 videos and generate corresponding SRT subtitle files. The subtitle files will be saved in the `output` directory located within the mp4srt directory.

After the execution is complete, you can find the generated subtitle files in the "output" directory. These files will have the same name as the corresponding input MP4 files, but with the ".srt" extension.
